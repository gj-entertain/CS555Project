## Estimate of hours
Around 3 days were spent on this project.
## How we tested code
Initially, I started with curl testing and developing. such as,


`Create user (/user POST)`


curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "testuser"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/user


`Get user (/user/<user_id> GET)`


curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/1


`Update user (/user/<user_id> PUT)`


curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "<user_key>", "real_name": "Tom", "avatar": "https://stevens.com/avatar.jpg' http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/1


`Create post (/post POST)`


curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"msg": "Hello world!", "user_id": 1, "user_key": "<user_key>"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/post


`Get post (/post/<post_id> GET)`


curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/post/1


`Delete post (/post/<post_id>/delete/<key> DELETE)`


curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/post/1/delete/<post_key>


`Get posts in range (/posts GET)`


curl 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/posts?start=2023-05-01T00:00:00&end=2023-05-01T23:59:59'


`Get posts by user (/user/<user_id>/posts GET)`


curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/user/1/posts


Then I tried to use Postman to test out API.
## Bugs and Issues that could not be resolved
No

## An example of difficult issue how I resolved
In our threading reply extension, we always encountered deadlocks, causing us to spend a considerable amount of time addressing the issue. However, through collaboration and research, we were able to overcome the problem and find a solution.

]
```

To test our endpoints, we write the following tests:
`POST` /user/ User 1 Creation

`GET` /user/{{user_id1}} Get User 1 Metadata

`PUT` /user/{{user_id1}} Edit User 1 Metadata

`GET` /user/{{user_id1}} Get User 1 Metadata again

`POST` /post Create a Post by User 1

`GET` /post/{{post_id1}} Read the Post by User 1

`POST` /user/ User 2 Creation

`GET` /user/{{user_id2}} Get User 2 Metadata

`PUT` /user/{{user_id2}} Edit User 2 Metadata

`GET` /user/{{user_id2}} Get User 2 Metadata again

`POST` /post Create Post 2 by User 2

`GET` /post/{{post_id2}} Read the Post 2

`POST` /post Create Reply by User 2

`GET` /post/{{reply_id}} Read the reply

`GET` /post/{{reply_id}} Read the Reply blow Post 1 by user 2

`GET` /posts/search?start_date={{post_timestamp1}}&end_date={{post_timestamp1}} Search Posts by date and time

`GET` /posts/user/{{user_id1}} Search Posts by User

`DEL` /post/{{post_id2}}/delete/{{post_key2}} Delete Post 2

To run these tests above, run ./test.sh or sudo ./test.sh.
